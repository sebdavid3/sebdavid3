## Hi there 👋

I'm a 5th-semester Systems Engineering student at Universidad del Norte in Barranquilla, Colombia. My interests include data analysis, artificial intelligence, and musical analysis.

Apart from programming, I'm also a violinist 🎻.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about AI and data-driven technologies.
- 🎶 I love exploring the intersection between music and technology.
- 📫 How to reach me: [sebdavidibanezrios@gmail.com].
- ⚡ Fun fact: I spend my weekends balancing coding and violin practice!
